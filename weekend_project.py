# Project Requirements


# User Interface (UI):
# Create a command-line interface (CLI) for the To-Do List Application.
# Display a welcoming message and a menu with the following options:
# ```
# Welcome to the To-Do List App!
#     Menu:
#     1. Add a task
#     2. View tasks
#     3. Mark a task as complete
#     4. Delete a task
#     5. Quit

#     ```
# To-Do List Features:
# Implement the following features for the To-Do List:
# Adding a task
# Viewing the list of tasks with from Incomplete and Complete tasks.
# Marking a task as complete.
# Deleting a task.
# Quitting the application.
# User Interaction:
# Allow users to interact with the application by selecting menu options using input().
# Implement input validation to handle unexpected user input gracefully.
# Error Handling:
# Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle potential issues.
# Code Organization:
# Organize your code into functions to promote modularity and readability.
# Use meaningful function names with appropriate comments and docstrings for clarity.
# Testing and Debugging:
# Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any bugs.
# Consider edge cases, such as empty task lists or incorrect user input.
# Documentation:
# Include a README file that explains how to run the application and provides a brief overview of its features.
# Optional Features (Bonus):
# If you feel adventurous, you can add extra features like task priorities, due dates, or color-coding tasks based on their status.
# GitHub Repository:
# Create a GitHub repository for your project.
# Commit your code to the repository regularly.
# Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation.

# Submission

# Submit your project, including all source code files and the README, to your instructor or designated platform.

# Project Tips

# Start by designing a simple user interface and plan the program's structure.
# Test your code frequently as you build each feature to ensure everything works as expected.
# Collaborate with fellow learners and seek help when needed. Remember, learning is a communal effort!

# By completing this project, you'll gain practical experience in Python programming and have a useful To-Do List Application to help you stay organized in your own life.


# Happy coding! üìãüêç
