# **To Do List Application**

## **Welcome to the To Do List Application!**

This application will keep track of things you need to do,
things you've accomplished, and allows you to remove tasks
if you just got a little to over ambitious.

## **How it Works:**

When the application starts you will be met with a menu screen
displaying all the available options. Users will follow the given 
prompts to and provided appropriate answers. The application will  
give an organized list of tasks to the user if prompted.

### Getting Started: ###

3. Mark completed
4. Remove a task
5. Quit

I would like to 

- Choose the appropriate numerical input for what you would like the application to do.

- Follow the prompts based off of your initial input.

    *ex. I would like to 1* 

- You will be prompted to add a task, view tasks, mark tasks completed, remove a task, or quit.

    *ex. What would you like to add to the list? clean*

- Once the appropriate action has been completed the application will display a message to confirm.

    *ex. Task added to list, get after it!*

- Once all actions have been completed the user will be returned to the menu to continue to use the application until the user input is QUIT.

    *ex. I would like to 5*

    *ex."Keep going we still need to ['clean', 'tennis',   'golf', 'cook']."*

    *"Great Job! You completed ['go karting!'], keep up the good work!"*
    
    *"You removed ['clean the house'], lets not make a habit of this."*

    *ex. "Task not on list, we can not remove that which does not exist."*

- If you complete something that is not on your list tha application will add it to the completed tasks if the user would like. 

    *ex. I would like to 3*

    *"What did you crush today? Go Karting!"*

    *"Whoaaa there buddy! The task wasn't on your list are you sure you did this? yes"*
